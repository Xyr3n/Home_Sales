# Home_Sales
## Overview
In this assignment, I used SparkSQL to analyze key metrics about home sales data. The process involved querying the dataset using SparkSQL, caching the table for performance optimization, parqueting the table for efficient storage, and finally uncaching the table.

## Question Answered
* Average price for a four-bedroom house each year.

* Average price of homes built each year with three bedrooms and three bathrooms.

* Average price of homes built each year with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and a living area greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet.

* Average price of homes per view rating that is greater than or equal to $350,000.

## Support
Referenced documentation from the website Databricks on how to uncaching the table.
